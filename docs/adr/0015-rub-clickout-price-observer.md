# ADR 0015: RUB Click-Out Price Observer

Date: 2026-06-23

## Status

Accepted for the current backend slice.

## Context

The product does not need in-app booking, order creation, payment processing or ticket issuing. The desired flow is:

1. Find the cheapest visible prices across relevant sources.
2. Show source, freshness and caveats.
3. Send the user to an external aggregator or official carrier website to buy in RUB.

## Decision

1. Flight Hunter is a price observer and click-out product, not a booking product.
2. Every source is represented as a `PriceSource` with:
   - source type;
   - price kind;
   - RUB support;
   - external purchase flow;
   - manual confirmation requirement.
3. API and cached sources are separated from external partner links and carrier websites.
4. Scraping is not a default adapter. A future scraping observer can exist only behind a feature flag and per-source permission check.
5. The scraping observer policy blocks:
   - CAPTCHA solving;
   - stealth/fingerprint spoofing;
   - rotating/residential proxies;
   - reused cookies;
   - login-required/private pages;
   - background collection.
6. Any scraped/displayed fare is labelled `observed_price`, not guaranteed availability.

## Consequences

- The app can guide users toward cheaper RUB purchase options without storing payment data.
- RU aggregators and official carrier sites can appear as click-out sources even when no public API exists.
- Real live automation remains source-by-source work, not a generic hidden scraper.
- The user can explicitly opt into risky scraping later, but the codebase keeps hard guardrails.

## Implementation note: 2026-06-29

The search API now returns a bundle-shaped result with priced offers, external check links,
browser-observed offers, deal candidates and a freshness summary. The current RU click-out
implementation builds conservative HTTPS base links only; it does not fabricate precise deeplinks,
prices, availability, booking URLs or live observations. `RU_AGGREGATORS_ENABLED` and
`CARRIER_LINKS_ENABLED` control which external check links are shown, and browser observation remains
behind explicit user-action policy/config gates.

The fixture parser slice also adds `GenericRuHtmlOfferExtractor`, which reads sanitized HTML with
explicit offer-card markers into `BrowserObservedOffer` values. It is intentionally offline and does
not navigate pages, bypass protections, solve CAPTCHA, reuse cookies or infer prices outside an
offer card.
